/**
 * Container healthcheck — used by both the Dockerfile HEALTHCHECK and
 * compose.prod.yml's `healthcheck:` block.
 *
 * The base oven/bun image is slim and ships neither `curl` nor `wget`, so we
 * use Bun's built-in fetch instead. Extracting this into a small script keeps
 * the YAML/Dockerfile readable (no JSON-escaped JS one-liners) and makes the
 * healthcheck logic discoverable in the codebase.
