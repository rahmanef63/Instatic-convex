/**
 * Plugin settings handler — implements the `cms.settings.replace` api-call.
 *
 * Validates the incoming settings record against the plugin's declared
 * setting definitions, then hands off to `persistAndSyncPluginSettings` —
 * the same split choke point as the admin PUT route (secret fields go
 * encrypted to `plugin_secrets`, everything else to `settings_json`) —
 * which refreshes the host cache, pushes the merged runtime record into
 * the running VM's `__plugin_settings` mirror, and emits `settings.changed`
 * (in that order — listeners reading `settings.get()` see the new values).
 * Because the push lands before the api-reply, the plugin's awaited
 * `settings.replace()` resolves with its mirror already updated.
 *
 * The reply value — which also seeds the worker's local mirror — is the
 * runtime record with decrypted secrets merged back in. It travels
 * host → worker only, never to a browser.
 *
 * No permission gate — any active plugin may update its own settings.
