/**
 * Plugin settings synchronization — keeps the views of a plugin's settings
 * consistent on every write:
 *
 *   1. the DB rows (`installed_plugins.settings_json` + the encrypted
 *      `plugin_secrets` table) — canonical,
 *   2. the host-side runtime cache (`../settingsCache.ts`) — non-secret
 *      values merged with decrypted secrets; seeds the worker's VM mirror
 *      at load time,
 *   3. the live VM mirror (`__plugin_settings`) — read synchronously by
 *      `api.cms.settings.get(...)` inside the sandbox.
 *
 * Both write paths converge on `persistAndSyncPluginSettings`: the admin
 * settings PUT (`server/handlers/cms/plugins/settings.ts`) and the plugin's
 * own `api.cms.settings.replace(...)` (`./handlers/settings.ts`).

/**
 * Persist a validated settings record and propagate it everywhere.
 *
 * Secret-typed fields are split into the encrypted `plugin_secrets` table
 * inside `setPluginSettings` (a `'***'` sentinel preserves the stored row,
 * a new value rotates it, an empty string clears it); a `PluginSecretError`
 * from that split propagates to the caller. The refreshed cache record —
 * non-secret values merged with the decrypted secrets — is the RUNTIME
 * view: it feeds the worker push and the `settings.changed` payload, and
 * must never be serialised onto a browser-bound payload.
 *
 * Ordering matters: the new record is pushed into the running VM BEFORE
 * `settings.changed` is emitted — hook listeners execute inside the worker
 * and read `api.cms.settings.get(...)` from the VM mirror, so the push has
 * to land first for a listener to observe the new values. A push failure is
 * logged rather than thrown: the DB rows are already the source of truth
 * and the next worker (re)load re-seeds the mirror from them.
 *
 * Returns the runtime record — the same shape `load-plugin` seeds at worker
 * load time.
