/**
 * Reconstruct the canonical `AiMessage[]` history a driver replays each turn
 * from the persisted `MessageRecord` rows.
 *
 * The persister writes each tool call and its result as SEPARATE rows: an
 * assistant row carrying the `toolCall` block, then later a `role:'tool'` row
 * carrying the result. If a stream aborts BETWEEN those two writes — a server
 * restart mid-turn, a dropped connection (`ERR_INCOMPLETE_CHUNKED_ENCODING`),
 * an aborted request — the assistant `tool_use` row persists but its result
 * row never does. Replaying that history verbatim sends an unanswered
 * `tool_use` to the provider, which every provider rejects (Anthropic:
 * "tool_use ids were found without tool_result blocks immediately after").
 *
 * This module is the single boundary that turns DB rows into provider-replay
 * messages, so it is the right place to heal that gap: every `tool_use` left
 * unanswered by the persisted rows gets a synthetic error `tool_result`. The
 * model sees that the prior turn's tool call was interrupted and can retry,
 * instead of the whole conversation becoming permanently un-sendable.
