/**
 * Remove a node and its entire subtree from a flat node map, in place.
 *
 * This is THE single subtree-deletion primitive. Every deletion path routes
 * through it:
 *   - `deleteNode` (page-tree mutations) — `unlinkParent: true`
 *   - `removeNodeSubtrees` (cascade VC-ref removal) — `unlinkParent: true`
 *   - slot-sync's delete op (visualComponents/slotSync) — `unlinkParent: false`
 *
 * The subtree is collected via the cycle-safe `collectSubtreeIds` walker, so a
 * corrupt tree containing a cycle terminates instead of looping forever.
 *
 * Parent unlink ALWAYS uses the O(1) `parentId` cache — never an O(N)
 * `Object.values` scan. `parentId` is a derived cache of the `children` arrays,
 * maintained by every mutation and restamped at every load/parse boundary, so
 * it is reliably populated for any tree that has entered the system.
 *
 * `unlinkParent` controls whether the root is spliced out of its parent's
 * `children[]`. Slot-sync passes `false` because it overwrites the VC ref's
 * `children` array wholesale afterwards (the parent fix is the caller's job).
 *
 * Safe to call inside a Mutative producer (the in-place splice/delete operate
 * on the draft) or on a plain object map.
