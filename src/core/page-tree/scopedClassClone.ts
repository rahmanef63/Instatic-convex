/**
 * Helper for cloning node-scoped CSS classes alongside node duplication.
 *
 * Per-node "module-style" classes carry `scope: { type: 'node', nodeId, role:
 * 'module-style' }` — they are conceptually owned by exactly one node. Any
 * mutation that clones one or more nodes (duplicateNode, duplicatePage, paste,
 * convert-to-VC) MUST also clone every node-scoped class whose `scope.nodeId`
 * is in the cloned set, with a fresh class id and the `scope.nodeId` rewritten
 * to point at the new node.
 *
 * Without this remap two nodes end up sharing the same scoped class — the
 * publisher emits ONE CSS rule per class name, so editing the original's
 * per-node style silently restyles the duplicate. See `F-0005`.
 *
 * `clipboardSlice.pasteNode` and `visualComponentsSlice.clonePageSubtreeToFlatNodes`
 * already implement this contract inline; this helper is the single source of
 * truth so duplicateNode / duplicatePage can use the same shape.

/**
 * For a set of nodes being cloned (oldId → newId), produce:
 *   - `added`: a list of new StyleRule entries the caller should write into
 *     `site.styleRules`. Each entry has a fresh id and a rewritten `scope.nodeId`.
 *   - `classIdRemap`: a map of oldClassId → newClassId for every node-scoped
 *     class that was cloned. Cloned-node classIds arrays should be remapped
 *     through this map (`classIdRemap.get(cid) ?? cid` — non-scoped class ids
 *     are not remapped and should pass through unchanged).
 *
 * Non-scoped classes (framework / regular reusable classes) are NOT cloned —
 * they are shared registry entries by design and the duplicate keeps the same
 * class id.
 *
 * Classes scoped to a node OUTSIDE the cloned set are NOT cloned and NOT
 * remapped — the duplicate inherits the reference verbatim, preserving the
 * existing semantics for cross-cloned-set scoping.
