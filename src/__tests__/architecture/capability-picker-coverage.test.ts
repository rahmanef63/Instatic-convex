/**
 * Architecture gate — every entry in `CORE_CAPABILITIES` must appear in
 * `CAPABILITY_META` AND in one `CAPABILITY_GROUPS` section. Otherwise a
 * new capability added to the canonical list would silently fall out of the
 * role-edit UI — admins couldn't grant it to a custom role.
 *
 * There is no longer a server-vs-client mirror check: `CORE_CAPABILITIES`
 * is defined once in `@core/capabilities` and imported by the server, so the
 * two sides cannot drift. This gate only guards the picker metadata, which is
 * genuinely separate from the list.
