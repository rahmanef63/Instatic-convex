/**
 * Architecture gate: every publish/unpublish entry point bumps the publish
 * version — either the bare `bumpPublishVersion()` (publishes, which already
 * hold the publish lock) or `bumpPublishVersionSerialized()` (retractions
 * outside a publish: unpublish, soft-delete, table move) — and imports it
 * from the publish-state module.
 *
 * Covered files:
 *   - server/publish/publishSite.ts             (publishDraftSite)
 *   - server/publish/publishRow.ts              (publishDataRow)
 *   - server/repositories/data/rows/mutations.ts (updateDataRowStatus — unpublish;
 *                                                 updateDataRowTable — route move)
 *
 * A simple text scan is sufficient — no AST parsing needed. The check matches
 * the pattern used by other architecture tests in this directory.
