/**
 * Freshness gate for the generated QuickJS plugin-bootstrap artifacts.
 *
 * The bootstrap is authored as real TypeScript under
 * `server/plugins/quickjs/bootstrap/src/` and bundled to committed string
 * artifacts under `…/bootstrap/generated/` by
 * `scripts/sync-plugin-bootstrap.ts`. The host evaluates those committed
 * strings inside the VM — so if the source changes but the artifact is not
 * regenerated, the VM would silently run stale code.
 *
 * This gate re-bundles the source in memory and asserts the committed
 * artifacts match byte-for-byte, exactly as `vendor-icons-fresh.test.ts` gates
 * the vendored icon set. Run `bun run bootstrap:sync` to refresh.
