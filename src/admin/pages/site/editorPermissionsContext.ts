/**
 * EditorPermissionsContext — the editor's three site-editing permission flags
 * surfaced as a single React context so every editor surface (canvas, panels,
 * trees, controls) can read them without prop-drilling.
 *
 * Split into a .ts (this file — context + hook) and a sibling .tsx
 * (`EditorPermissionsProvider.tsx`) because React Fast Refresh requires a
 * file to export only components OR only non-components. The `.tsx` provider
 * file is what consumers wrap the editor body in; the hook here is what
 * every other surface reads.
 *
 * `useEditorPermissions()` always returns a value — the default is "full
 * access" so any consumer that renders outside a Provider (legacy callers,
 * Storybook stories, unit tests of leaf components) gets the historical
 * behaviour without needing to wire anything up.
 *
 * The values flow from `AdminCanvasLayout` which computes them from the
 * authenticated user's capabilities (via `src/admin/access.ts`).
