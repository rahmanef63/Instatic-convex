/**
 * Markdown rendering for the AI assistant chat.
 *
 * Pipeline: marked.parse(text) → DOMPurify (via sanitizeRichtext) → safe HTML.
 * The chat displays text from Claude (and the user's own input), and Claude's
 * responses regularly contain markdown — bold, lists, inline code, links.
 *
 * Sanitisation uses the project's existing `sanitizeRichtext`, which is
 * already configured with safe-by-default tags + a hook that rewrites every
 * <a> to `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`. That's the same surface
 * the publisher trusts, so chat output meets the same bar.
 *
 * Streaming: this helper is called per text block on every render. `marked`
 * handles partial input gracefully (an unfinished `**` simply renders as
 * literal characters), so the live-streaming text is safe to re-parse on
 * each frame.
 */
